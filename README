== Welcome to s13

This is a Ruby on Rails application specifically setup to keep track of territories.


== Version 1.0

This edition is mostly ready to go. It has simple features that I hope to expand to an easier interface and add more options. Frankly it is a little choppy now but I will continue to refine it.
